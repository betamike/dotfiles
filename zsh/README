# My ZSH configs

All the files prefixed with `omz_` are default configs from oh-my-zsh.
I'm in the process of migrating off of oh-my-zsh but I'm used to -- and
like -- some of those default configs. I'm slowly looking into each one
and deciding if I want to keep it or remove it.

## Completions

Put completions in `~/.zsh/completions`.

## Functions

Put functions in `~/.zsh/functions`.
